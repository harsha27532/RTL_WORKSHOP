## 1️⃣ Introduction and Cloud Lab Instructions

### 1.1 Workshop Structure

The workshop is organized module by module, each covering a specific stage of the RTL-to-synthesis flow,starting with simulation fundamentals and progressing through synthesis, timing libraries, and flip-flop coding styles. Each module pairs short conceptual explanations with hands-on labs, so tool setup only needs to be done once, here in Module 0.

### 1.2 Using the Cloud Lab

For anyone who doesn't want to set up a local Linux environment, the workshop provides a browser-based cloud lab with all required tools pre-installed. This is the fastest way to get started, since it skips the installation steps in Section 2 entirely.

To use it:

1. Open the cloud lab platform provided by the workshop.
2. Sign in with the enrollment credentials issued for the course.
3. Launch the pre-configured virtual machine from the dashboard.

## 2️⃣ Local Lab Installation

### 2.1 System Requirements

Local installation assumes an Ubuntu (Linux system), either natively or inside a virtual machine such as Oracle VM VirtualBox.
### 2.2 Installing Icarus Verilog and GTKWave

```bash
sudo apt install iverilog
sudo apt install gtkwave
```

### 2.3 Installing Yosys

```bash
sudo apt install yosys
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
```

### 2.4 Verifying the Installation

Confirm each tool installed correctly and check its version:

```bash
iverilog -V
gtkwave --version
yosys -V
```
